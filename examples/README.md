# Overview
Folder for dozer example files

## Arduino Directories
Arduino directories typically contain .ino and .h files.

### `motor_test/`
Contains .ino file to test each of the three DC motors on the dozer through acceleration
and decceleration in both forward and reverse. Browse this file to understand how to use
the Adafruit MotorShield V2.

### `encoder_test/`
Contains .ino file to test each of the three encoders hooked up to the gearboxes. Displays
encoder values while running motors in both forward and reverse. Browse this file to
understand how to properly set up encoders on interrupts.
